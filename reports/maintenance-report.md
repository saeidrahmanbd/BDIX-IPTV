## Protection
- Duplicate stream URLs are blocking.
- Primary streams are protected from silent removal.
- Backup streams are never deleted because of health failures.
- New Channels and New Backup remain active discovery/review queues.
- Backup counts do not imply independent CDN/origin redundancy.
- Report freshness is checked against current source hashes or the current three-playlist inventory; mismatched metrics are labelled stale instead of shown as current.
