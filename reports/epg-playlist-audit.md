## Interpretation

- Mapped IDs means a playlist identity was connected to a source XMLTV ID.
- Current/future source schedules means source data contains eligible programmes with valid non-empty titles in any language inside the generator's -6-hour/+7-day window; overlapping title variants are selected English first, Bengali second, then other valid languages.
- IDs in published guide and IDs with published schedules are verified against XMLTV using the playlist's tvg-id identities; these counts are not source-provider IDs.
- Domestic Bangladesh channels are not fuzzy-matched to similarly named Indian or foreign services. They remain unmapped until a trustworthy listing source or an exact explicit mapping can be verified.
