## Summary

| BDIX-Playlist.m3u | 185 | 0 |

## Remaining affected NVisionBD channel labels


## Scope and quality rules

- A replacement must be a validated image, must not contain the CHANNEL MARK template, and must have a source recorded in the replacement-results report.
- If multiple channels share a name, or no trustworthy source is found, the placeholder is retained and listed for manual review.
- Old generic files are not deleted automatically, to avoid breaking any other reference.
